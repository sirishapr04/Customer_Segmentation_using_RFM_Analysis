# Customer_Segmentation_using_RFM_Analysis





## Project Overview

My goal was to explore customer behavior through RFM analysis and create distinct customer segments. By analyzing the data, we aimed to help businesses fine-tune their marketing strategies and improve customer retention. The dataset, spanning from December 2010 to December 2011, initially contained 541,909 rows. After data cleaning, we worked with 539,392 rows.

## Key Findings

### Customer Segmentation 

#### Unique Customers: 
The dataset featured 4,372 unique customers.

#### Churn Rate:
I discovered that the customer churn rate was 30.02%, indicating a significant opportunity for targeted retention strategies.

#### Order Distribution:
The average number of orders per customer was 4.27, with considerable variability in the data.

### Product Insights
#### Top Products: 
I identified the top 10 most ordered products and assessed their revenue contributions.

#### Pricing Trends: 
I examined the pricing of top-selling products, which varied significantly, and calculated average product prices and revenue.

### Time-Based Trends 
#### Order Timing: 
Most orders were placed on Thursdays between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM. I also observed a seasonal spike in orders towards the end of the year, likely due to holiday shopping.

### Geographical Analysis 
#### Top Countries: 
The United Kingdom led in order volume, followed by Germany, France, Ireland, and Belgium. I found that average order values varied significantly by country.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
The insights from my RFM analysis underscored the importance of personalized marketing strategies and continuous monitoring of customer behavior. My key recommendations include:

#### Targeted Retention Efforts:
Implement exclusive deals to reduce churn and engage high-value customers.

#### Strategic Timing:
Align marketing efforts with peak purchasing times to maximize impact.

#### Geographical Targeting:
Focus on regions with high order volumes and optimize average order values.

This project demonstrated the power of RFM analysis in revealing customer dynamics and providing actionable insights for businesses to thrive in a competitive online market. Through detailed analysis and strategic segmentation, I aimed to equip businesses with the tools needed to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize their market strategies.
